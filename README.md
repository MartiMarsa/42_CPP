# C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals
This repository contains a series of exercises aimed at introducing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++98, the earlier version of the C++ programming language. The project is part of a learning journey designed to help beginners start their C++ development skills and understand the foundations of OOP.

About the Project

C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, often referred to as "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia). The main goal of these modules is to provide an accessible introduction to OOP, starting with a focus on core principles like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, while maintaining simplicity by adhering to the C++98 standard.

The choice of C++98 was made to keep the learning process grounded in the fundamentals of the language, allowing new learners to build a strong base. Despite the fact that modern C++ (from C++11 onward) introduces new features and capabilities, the focus of this repository is to lay the groundwork for those who may want to explore more advanced concepts later.
Learning Objectives

    Introduction to C++ and OOP: Learn how to write C++ code that follows the principles of object-oriented design.
    Step-by-Step Progression: The exercises increase in complexity, gradually helping you build and refine your understanding of OOP concepts.
    C++98 Standard: All code in this repository adheres to the C++98 standard to maintain simplicity while laying a solid foundation in C++ programming.

Why C++98?

While modern C++ offers many improvements, including features like smart pointers, lambdas, and multithreading support, C++98 offers a simplified approach, making it easier for beginners to focus on understanding the core concepts of object-oriented programming. This approach ensures that you become familiar with fundamental structures before diving into more advanced features.
Project Structure

This repository includes a series of progressively challenging exercises and concepts:

    Basic Classes & Objects
    Constructors, Destructors, and Member Functions
    Inheritance & Polymorphism
    Encapsulation & Abstraction

Each exercise is designed to help solidify the understanding of key OOP concepts while writing and testing C++ code.
